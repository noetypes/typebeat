// Headless coverage of the health / fail model (backlog item 9): sustained not-typing must
// drain HP and fail the play, while imperfect-but-complete play survives. The engine is the
// judgement authority; these tests bridge its judgements into TypeBeatHealthProcessor exactly
// as TypeBeatPlayfield does (CharJudged -> Great/Ok/Meh, seal misses -> Miss, wrong keys ->
// ApplyWrongKeyStreak), so they exercise the real magnitudes end-to-end without a game host.
