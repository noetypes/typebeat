// Backlog 182: the two WORD-LEVEL editing gestures every typing site has, brought into live
// gameplay. Ctrl+Backspace erases the previous word (the gaps behind the caret, then the word behind
// them); Ctrl+A offers back the run from the caret to the start of the word holding the EARLIEST
// unfixed mistake (backlog 184 inverted that from the nearest), so every mistake is retyped in one
// go. Backlog 244 made "mistake" cover a cell a WORD SKIP abandoned as well as a typed-through typo,
// which is what lets a player who skipped a word select back over it and, by retyping it, redeem the
// combo claim the skip took against it.
//
// The engine's whole share of that is TWO PURE QUERIES, TypingEngine.WordBackspaceTarget and
// TypingEngine.RetypeSelectionAnchor, which say where each gesture stops and mutate nothing. This
// file pins them, and pins the COMPOSITION the input layer builds on top of them (a run of
// ProcessBackspace calls plus at most one ProcessKey), because that composition is the reason the
// feature needs no new replay frame and no new era bit: a stored run holds exactly the engine calls
// the live run made. TestSceneTypeBeatWordInput drives the same gestures through the real key
// handler and proves the recorded replay re-derives them.
