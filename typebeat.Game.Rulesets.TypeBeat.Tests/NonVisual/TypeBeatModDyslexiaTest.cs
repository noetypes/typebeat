// Dyslexia (backlog 231): the letters of a word may be typed in ANY ORDER. The whole mod is one
// fork at the expected-character lookup in TypingEngine.ProcessKey plus an arm in each of the two
// engine factories, so this fixture pins three things and nothing else:
//
//   1. the SHIPPING SURFACE (acronym, type, unranked, incompatibility, the one flag it flips);
//   2. the FORK, from both sides: the flag off must be byte-identical to today, the flag on must be
//      identical again for in-order play, and an out-of-order press must be graded, announced,
//      restored and rendered against the cell it actually landed on;
//   3. the CARET INVARIANT the rest of the engine reads, which is what stops the mod leaking into
//      the rush cap, the Flashlight window and line completion: the caret is the leftmost cell
//      nobody has typed, whatever order the ones after it arrived in.
//
// Every expected delta below is hand-computed beside its assert, in the style of TypingEngineTest.
