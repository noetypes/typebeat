// Backlog 260: ONE LAW, an accidental word skip that is then typed out in full costs the run
// NOTHING. A player finished a map with every one of its 920 cells typed, 0 misses, and a max combo
// of 919. The increment missing was the WORD GAP the skipping space was itself judged on, and it was
// being dropped in two different ways:
//
//   A  the RUSH CAP charged the space for the word it abandoned. skipCurrentWord walks the caret
//      past the whole word before the same press is judged on the gap, and the cap measures the
//      caret POSITIONALLY, so the abandoned tail was spent out of a budget the player never touched.
//      Over the cap the gap earned no combo, silently: the skip's own break had already zeroed the
//      run, so there was no ComboBroken and no claim discarded, and the gap still resolved Correct,
//      which makes every later retype of it inert.
//
//   B  the PASSIVE CLAIM arm (backlog 243) dropped the run it stood on. The break's call site has
//      already run breakRun, so a passive break that keeps the older claim and discards its own
//      brokenStreak throws those increments away with nothing left to redeem them.
//
// Both move a stored replay's max_combo, so both are gated on the one era flag
// (TypingEngine.LosslessSkipReclaim, CONFIG frame bit 11) and the pins below are written in pairs:
// the live arm, and the arm every stored row was played under.
