// Backlog 140: correcting a typo RESUMES the combo its wrong keypress broke.
//
// Typos are counted as EVENTS (one per wrong keypress, spent the instant the key lands and never
// refundable), so without this the only thing going back to fix a cell would buy is the accuracy
// and completion the cell itself is worth: the combo would be gone either way, and leaving the
// typo sitting there would cost nothing extra. These pins cover the rule and its three edges: the
// plain fix, the intervening break that ends the claim, and repeated wrong/fix cycles on one cell.
//
// TypeBeatReplayScorerTest.AFixedTypoResumesTheStreakOnlyUnderTheLiveRule is the fourth: the same
// keystrokes re-derived under both eras, through the real score processor.
//
// The last three PAIRS are backlog 176, which traced a player report that a corrected typo did not
// restore. The report was accurate: two wrong keys landed on ADJACENT cells 447 combo deep, and the
// second one rewrote the snapshot the first had taken, with the combo AT THAT MOMENT, which the
// first wrong key had already zeroed. The player then corrected both cells and got nothing back.
//
// The rule that fixes it is that a break takes ownership of the streak only if it HAS a streak to
// own: a break landing while the run is already at zero costs nothing, so it leaves an outstanding
// claim alone instead of replacing it with an empty one. The three shapes that reach it are a wrong
// key on the next cell, a wrong key on the same cell, and a word skip over a typo, and each is
// pinned twice: once live, once under ComboClaimRule.LatestBreakWins, the arm every score stored
// before 176 was played under. JudgementEraTest.ABreakThatCostNothing... holds the same split for a
// whole submitted account, through the real score processor.
//
// The LAST group is backlog 243, which traced a second player report of the same complaint, and it
// is 176 in the one shape 176 could not see. A real play (score 10762: 1303 cells, every break
// walked back and corrected, and a max_combo of 869 instead of 1303) skipped a word and then typo'd
// immediately after it. The skipping space is judged on the word gap it lands on, so it rebuilds the
// run to 1, so the typo broke a streak of ONE and not of zero, cleared 176's test, and overwrote a
// 430-deep claim with a worthless one. The rule that fixes it is that the claim remembers the combo
// its OWN press credited: a break taking no more than that is as passive as one landing at zero, and
// spends the credit as it goes. A correct character in between puts the run at 2 and the next break
// takes the claim exactly as it always did, which is the counter-case pinned below.
//
// BACKLOG 262 answers that counter-case rather than moving it. A break with a streak of its own
// still TAKES the claim, and the cell that redeems is still its own, but the claim it displaces is
// FOLDED IN rather than dropped: a third report (score 13383, 477 combo deep, a typo on a letter, the
// next letter typed correctly, a typo on the word gap after it, then three backspaces and a perfect
// retype) got 1 back for two accidents it had corrected in full. The pairs below are written the way
// 176, 243 and 260's are: the live arm, and the arm every stored row was played under
// (TypingEngine.FoldsDisplacedClaim, CONFIG frame bit 12).
